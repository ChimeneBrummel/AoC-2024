# Advent of Code 2024

This project uses Typescript with Deno.
-All days contain a deno.json so the code can be run using Deno.
-All days contain 2 parts.
-All parts contain a example.txt and a input.txt. The example.txt is for the example input given. The input.txt is for the bigger input for the day which is the actual puzzle data.
-The code.ts is for the actual code needed to solve the part.

To run the code run the following commands:
```
cd Day [dayNumber]
cd Part [Part 1]
deno run -A code.ts
```
> [!NOTE]
> The -A is so that Deno is allowed to read the file, since Deno needs to be given permission before being allowed to read the file.
